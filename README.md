# **PF Moocher**

Pot Farm fans rejoice!  While the "Pot Farm Moocher PRO" is an important tool in pushing your Pot Farm, most people don't bother.  Why?  Because sitting in front of your computer clicking through thousands of entries to get your max collections is just a bore (and something we do enough within the game itself)!

Meet PF Moocher - Automatically click through those thousands of items, and save your time and clicking energy for your farm!  Change a few settings, click "Run" and site back, PF Moocher takes care of the rest.  Get your daily limits on collections and all of the reward crates within minutes - all while pumping those clicks where it counts - YOUR FARM!

PF Moocher is a simple utility, and does NOT store or cache Facebook login details, nor does it record any cookie data Facebook loves to throw all over the web.  What it lacks in technicality, it makes up for in time saved.

## *Interface Explanation*

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/arICyn8.png)

 - **"Facebook Nav" Button:** Navigates the bot to Facebook (Use whenever you need to login)
 - **"Moocher Nav" Button:** Navigates the bot to the Moocher (use after logging in to Facebook)
 - **"Cycles" Dropdown:** Sets the number of pages/refreshes the bot will run through
 - **"Target" Dropdown:** Sets the click-target (ie. Wall, Rally, Prizes)
 - **"Throtle" Dropdown:** Sets the speed at which the bot runs (lower for older computers/slow internet, higher for  newer/faster internet.  Default of 6 works for most people)
 - **"Run" Button:** Runs the bot of course!
 - **"RESET" Button:** Resets the bot (requires you to login again!)
 - **"Status" Label:** Output field for the status of the bot (not working correctly at the moment)

## *Run Instructions*

 1. Execute "PF Moocher.exe"
 2. Use the "Facebook Nav" button to navigate to Facebook (if not already loaded)
 3. Set the number of cycles to run (default of 30 usually covers it - simply "Run" the bot again if not)
 4. Set your Target ("Both") will hit both Rally and Wall cycles - I use this by default)
 5. Set the Throttle (default of 6 works for most people - raise it if you think you could run faster, lower it if you aren't hitting all the clickable posts)
 6. Hit the "Run" button, and kick back.  

## *Some Notes*

 - For the first few times (or when using a new computer), you may want to watch the bot to ensure all posts are clicked (If not, lower the "Cycles").
 - While the "RESET" button DOES reset the bot (logs out, puts settings back to default), it does NOT interrupt the bot if it is running cycles.
 - Bot going crazy or need to interrupt the bot while its cycling?  Simply exit the bot, and restart.
 - PF Moocher is "undetectable" by the Pot Farm crew - it does not engage any part of the game itself, it just simply clicks through the HTML on the page.  I imagine the speed of collection might raise some eyebrows, but that info is likely not tracked, and I have been using this for years at this point. Use at your own risk in any situation, but I doubt they would even have any qualms with this in the first place.

## *"Infected" Notes*

PF Moocher.exe was programmed using UBot Studio - as a result, the software shows up as "Infected" by online AntiVirus software, as well as a number of installed AntiVirus products.  While these products do indeed report the software as "Infected", I can assure you, the results stem from what are known as "False Positives".  

I won't get super technical about the rampant issue of AV Products and the terrifyingly inaccuracy they often posses (not that it would make sense to most), I do of course want people to be comfortable knowing that this bot is safe, so here are some links explaining False Positives as well as how the issue is affecting the UBot Studio IDE:

 - [BlackhatWorld.com's take on the matter](https://www.blackhatworld.com/seo/ubot-high-detection-ratio.573902/)

That being said, if you are STILL worried about the bot actually being infected (against all of the above information)...

*Don't use it.*

I didn't include a login/account system because of this very issue, and have no issues with anyone with applicable experience doing a full code analysis for malware or virus issues.  I simply chose to release PF Moocher.exe for the benefit of my Rally group, and anyone  who happens to stumble upon it.  Again, I can understand the reasonable concerns people may have with unknown software creators (ie. Me) leaving behind nasty bits of code, but given my above explanation, if you still are concerned, than just don't use it :)
